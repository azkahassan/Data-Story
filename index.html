          <h2>Headline</h2>
          <p>Seeking to support domestic violence victims, <a<a href=http://www.ctcadv.org/</a> CCADV (Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence) often interacts with callers from all over the state and provides a wide array of services. For many cases, 2 or 3 interactions are simply not enough, nor is the provision of 2 or 3 services. In order to identify patterns in regions among frequent callers and the services that pertain to those calls, we are trying to answer the following question; Which services are recurring amongst frequent callers in each region?</p>

          <p>We believe that CCADV can greatly benefit from learning more about their frequent callers, where they tend to be located, and the services that they receive. It can provide valuable insight on what services are effectively helping their callers to resolve their problems. The frequency of calls before the resolution of the problems may also reveal the effectiveness of the services provided to them. Being aware of their callers, their location, and the services they are likely to receive can help CCADV be well-equipped in helping their frequent callers based on their location.

        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          
          <p>We began by defining some of the terms that will be used in our data. Frequent callers are those who called CCADV more than 11 times. We calculated the median number of calls among all the callers from 2020 to 2021 excluding 1-time calls so that we can avoid the inclusion of outliers such as 75 calls affecting our data. 
The following is a map that shows the percentage of callers in each region who reached out to CCADV more than 11 times from 2020 to 2021:
</a>

          <p>We then made pivot tables that summarize calls greater than 11 in each region which includes CCADV’s services. The services provided by CCADV are the following: Counseling, Victim advocacy, Civil Legal, Criminal Justice, Safety planning, Info provided, and Referrals. We found that 100% of the frequent callers have used at least one of these services. We normalized our data by calculating the percentages of different services provided by CCADV in each region for frequent callers. We also calculated the mean percentage of different services provided in all regions of Connecticut, and in every region, we selected those services that are above the mean percentage. For example, we calculated the percentage of calls that include counseling services, calculated a mean of those percentages, and selected those regions in which counseling percentages were higher than its mean. This would mean (pun intended) that the frequent callers from those selected regions are more likely to utilize counseling services than the frequent callers from regions where counseling percentages are below their mean.</p>
 
          <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>    
          <p>The following is a map that shows the percentage of callers in each region who reached out to CCADV more than 11 times from 2020 to 2021:</p>
    <iframe title="New Haven records an astounding 45% of callers who called more than 11 times" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-aoMX3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aoMX3/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="613"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
          <p>From this map, we can see that according to the CCADV data, the New Haven region has the highest percentage of frequent callers, followed by the Hartford region, New Britain region, Middletown region, and Danbury region. All these callers have used at least one of the services.

<p>The map below shows the most prominent services provided in each region of Connecticut by CCADV. It also gives the percentage of that service used in the region.</p>
    <iframe title=" Counseling services are the highest demanded services in almost all of the regions" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-w9ZUe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/w9ZUe/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="583"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
<p>The map shows that the counseling services dominate most of the regions except the Mansfield and Enfield region. Information service is provided at significant amounts in the Mansfield region and Victim Advocacy service is popular in the Enfield region.</p>
       
          <p>The chart below shows the services in each region with a higher percentage than its mean percentage of service:</p>
<iframe title="Percentage of services provided to frequent callers above the mean" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-RIg8G" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RIg8G/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="543"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
 <p>This chart illustrates how overall, CCADV heavily provides Counseling and Victim Advocacy services to their frequent callers. After Counseling and Victim Advocacy, a significant number of callers are also provided with Information Provision and Safety Planning.</p>
 <p>This table consists of the percentages of different services used by frequent callers. It shows how Info Provided followed by Safety planning are two of the highest demanded services among all services used by CCADV’s frequent callers.</p>

         <h2>Data sources and methods</h2> 
        <p>Primarily, we used 2020-2021 masked CCADV data. From those data, we used list callers having more than 10 instances in each region. At the same time, we used records of services provided by CCADV to those frequent callers. Here is the link to CCADV masked data that we used: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCZftO7ukIlodahZZGwbt5dTAPgenRM6VxO6-Lb_wdQ/edit#gid=1352497557</p>
